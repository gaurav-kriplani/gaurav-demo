                        The Service is controlled and operated from its facilities in the United States. Cardpool makes no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use the Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Service are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in the United States.

                        A. Governing Law. You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Cardpool, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any claim or dispute between you and Cardpool that arises in whole or in part from the Service shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Santa Clara County, California, unless submitted to arbitration as set forth in the following paragraph.<br />
                        B. Arbitration. For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) under this Agreement where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, Cardpool may elect to resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. If Cardpoool elects for arbitration, Cardpoool shall initiate the arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules:<br /> a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, as selected by the party initiating the arbitration;<br /> b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and<br /> c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br />
                        C. Notification Procedures. Cardpool may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes (e.g., in the case of any substantive changes to this Agreement), to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Cardpool in our sole discretion. Cardpool reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. Cardpool is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. We recommend that you add notifications@cardpool.com to your email address book to help ensure you receive email notifications from us. Notices to Cardpool should be sent to:<br />

                        D. Entire Agreement/Severability. This Agreement, together with any amendments and any documents referenced herein, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Cardpool concerning the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Cardpool in any respect whatsoever.<br />
                        E. No Waiver. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Cardpool's failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. All waivers and modifications to this Agreement must be in a writing signed by both parties that expressly by its terms modifies or waives a provision of this Agreement.<br />
