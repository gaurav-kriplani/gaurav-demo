                    <b>• What is a Gift Card?</b><br />

                    A gift card is a pre-paid debit card that can be used at a specific store or franchise. Some people buy gift cards as presents when they don't know exactly what to get someone. Others use them to budget their everyday spending at a certain store. For instance, buying a Rs.1000 gift card to use for lunch at the Restaurant near your office.

                    Gift cards have no fees and most have no expiration date. The only limit to a gift card is where you can spend it. Sometimes people receive a gift card for a business they don't care for. For example, a vegetarian might win a KFC gift card in a raffle. Or you might buy a Home Furnishing gift card for a remodeling project and only end up spending half of it.

                    Gift cards are non-refundable, but they are 100% legally transferable to any other person. After all, gift cards are specifically made to be given away and used by others!<br />



                    <b>• What is a Discount Gift Card?</b><br />

                    A discount gift card is a perfectly valid gift card that someone else didn't need or want anymore. Say you get a Shoppers Stop gift card with Rs.500 left on it... and you don't see anything else there you want. You might be willing to sell it for Rs.300 cash that you can use anywhere. The person who buys it from you would get a nice discount at Shoppers Stop and you get cash, it's a win-win.

                    Just a few years ago, selling an unwanted card was a hassle. People would post newspaper classifieds or Online ads. Not anymore. The demand for discount gift cards and the fabulous savings they offer has inspired us to create a New Marketplace-Card2Money. First, we certify the cards are 100% valid and then they pay you in your C2M Wallet which gives you the power to shop were you want or to simply pay your bills.<br />


                    <b>• What is Card2Money?</b><br />

                    Card2Money is a gift card exchange marketplace that helps buyers find discounted gift cards and help sellers, by giving them an option to unleash the power of their unused gift cards.<br />


                    <b>• How do we work?</b><br />

                    Card2Money connects all the gift card holders in India to create a gift card exchange marketplace where customers can buy or sell their gift cards easily and safely. By gathering all the buyers and sellers in one place, Card2Money helps everyone get exactly what they want, whether its a discounted gift card, a different gift card, or simply money in their C2M Wallet.<br />


                    <b>• Who am I buying from or selling to?</b><br />

                    You are always buying directly from us and selling directly to us. Card2Money buys our gift cards directly from our customers, verifies the authenticity and balance of each gift card, and holds on to them until a buyer is found. Even though we may never find a buyer for a given gift card, we pay sellers as soon as the authenticity of the gift card is verified.<br />

                <center>  <h4>Buyers</h4></center><br />
                <p class="leftmargin1">
                    <b>• Are there any fees when purchasing a gift card from Card2Money?</b><br />

                    The price you see is the price you pay. There are no additional fees of any kind.<br />


                    <b>• How does Card2Money ensure that every transaction is guaranteed?</b><br />

                    Card2Money is in possession of every gift card listed on the site. Card2Money verifies the value of each card before it is sent to the buyer to ensure the value is correct.<br />


                    <b>• What happens if I receive my gift card and it is not the correct value?</b><br />

                    We offer 60 days’ guarantee promising that the stated value of the gift card is what you will receive. If the value is different and you contact us within 60 days from your purchase date, we will send you another gift card to make up the discrepancy or send you the difference in your C2M Wallet.<br />
